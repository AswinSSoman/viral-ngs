To de novo assembly, adding a finishing step that tries to reduce or close assembly gaps.

Notes on the finishing step:

The finishing step will use some of the same techniques as the main assembly; however,
making it a separate step has several advantages:
   - the finishing step will only be run on assemblies on which the main pipeline leaves gaps;
   and it will accept the scaffolds from them main pipeline as correct.  This means that
   the step does not have the potential to make results worse for some samples (unlike changes
   to the main assembly pipeline).  It will be relatively safe to use more experimental
   techniques in this step.
   - the finishing step will only be run for a fraction of samples, and for those it will focus
   on reconstructing only a fraction of the genome.  This means more expensive techniques
   can be used, such as overlap-based assembly.

Some approaches we'll use in the finishing step:

  - bringing in additional reads that were potentially relevant to the taxon, but were
    not used in the main assembly.  These can be sourced from the cleaned reads, or
    optionally from the raw reads (ideally of course we would fix depletion so that
    going back to raw reads is never needed)

    For a given gap, we can bring in reads that
       - align to the gap edges
       - align to the gap sequence in any of the known references
       - are paired mates of reads that do the above
       - share some overlap with reads that do the above	 
	 
  - reassemble potentially gap-spanning contigs from all reads potentially relevant to each gap
